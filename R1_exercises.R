### You will work with the mtcars data set to complete these exercises.

################################################################################

# First, save the data frame as "my_data"

mydata <- mtcars

# Examine the structure of mtcars, and also look at the first few observations. Type ?mtcars to get a 
# description of each variabe.

str(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
?mtcars

## Exercise 1: Which gets better mileage - automatic or manual cars? ##

# 1a. Is "am" (automatic or manual) correctly identified as a factor variable? If not, convert it to one.



# 1b. Recode the "am" variable so that 0 = automatic and 1 = manual. Hint: try following the instructions
# on this website: https://rpubs.com/Mentors_Ubiqum/Rename_Levels. 



# 1c. Create a subset of data called "automatic_data" that includes only the automatic cars.



# 1d. Do the same for manual cars; call it "manual_data."



# 1e. Calculate the mean mpg for both automatic and manual cars. Which gets better mileage?



## Exercise 2: We are going to return now to the full mtcars data set. Which car is heaviest? ##

# 2a. Use a new command - summary(mtcars$wt) to get some descriptive statistics about that variable. 



# 2b. Use what you have learned about indexing only certain observations to find out which car has the highest
# weight. Hint: find where the max weight (from 2a) appears in the data.



# 2c. Which car has the lowest weight?



## Exercise 3: Is there a relationship between weight and mpg? ##

# The commands in this exercise will be new to you, but will serve as an introduction to next week's lesson. 

# 3a. First, examine your data. You can use hist(variable) name to create a histogram. Get histograms for both
# variables; you will see them appear in the panel to your right.



# 3b. We now want to make a basic scatterplot with weight on the x-axis and mpg on the y=axis. You can do this using
# plot(variable on x axis, variable on y axis).



# 3c. Look at the plot. Does there appear to be a relationship? How would you describe it?



# 3d. Is there a significant correlation between the two? We can examine this relationship numerically using the cor.test 
# function. Use ?cor.test or Google it to see which inputs you need, and try to work through it on your own. Does this 
#  resultmatch your expectation? 
# Hint: you will know you have performed the correct test if you found a correlation coefficient (r) of -.87.
